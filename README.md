# Cloudbudget_webPage

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

## The Challenge.

This project is created to build out the website of service for a fiction company called CloudBudget. The design of this
website was taken for the Mobile Design, UX Design / Research, Web Design Mohammad Ali, published in his Dribble acount 
(https://dribbble.com/ScratchCoders); I try to get it looking as close to the design as possible and adding my 
own some particulars features to the website as the responsive and other functionalities.

I expect that users should be able to:
  1.View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size. 
  2.Have full interaction with the website.

## Building the Project. 

The start of build out this project was creating the structure of the website with [HTML5] specifications. Trying 
to define the diferents sections, elements and components that the website has guided for the visual desgin of the
'CloudBudget' website. Continue with the definition of the [CSS3] layout also based of the visual desgin of the website,
with their own responsive design. And finally giving some funtionality with a carousel section in [JavaScript]. 

All previous, with a proffesional [Git] and [GitHub] workflow, [BEM] metodology,  and the special attention on creating 
well-structured content. 

This is a public repository on [gitHub]; was not carried out for profit and completely free.

Again, thanks a lot for checking out this project. 

Â¡Â¡happy coding!!
